            <h3 id="caption">Blaine Harper. American Dive. New Haven, Connecticut.</h3>
            <p>I spent two months in Connecticut this year. We would come
                down to this beach and swim<br> or fish almost every night.</p>

            <h3 id="caption">Jake Wickersham. Wallride Nollie Out. Lawrence, Kansas.</h3>
            <p>Shooting other skatephotographers is always rad! Jake is an
                 amazing young photographer<br> that is really starting to make
                  things happen. He had several photos run in skate magazines
                   <br>this year.</p>

            <h3 id="caption">Zach Elder. Switch Bluntslide. Kansas City, Missouri.</h3>
            <p>I've been skating with Zach for about 15 years now.
                 Zach is not only a great skater but also<br> an amazing
                  videographer. He is currently working on a project
                   for Chophouse Skateboards.<br> I can't wait to see it!</p>

            <h3 id="caption">Jason Bontrager. Feeble Grind. Kansas City, Kansas.</h3>
            <p>We refer to this day as Feeblepalooza. We went to this rail to
                 shoot a photo of my friend<br> Scotty smith grinding it. We didn't
                  really expect Jason to feeble it that day. After Scotty got<br>
                   his trick, Jason starting rolling up to the rail. About fifteen
                    minutes later he rolled away perfectly.</P>

            <h3 id="caption">Shawn Hale. Backside Noseblunt. Joplin, Missouri.</h3>
            <p>Shawn grew up in my hometown of Joplin, Missouri. Shawn is on the
                 verge of turning pro<br> for Birdhouse Skateboards, Tony Hawk's company.
                 The local skate shop flew Shawn in to<br> do a demo in August. It's amazing
                 to see how much he has progressed.</P>

            <h3 id="caption">Scotty Laird. Bluntslide. Irvine, California.</h3>
            <p>Our friend Yosef took Scotty and I to this ditch in Irvine. When he described
                 it to us, I wasn't<br> really sure we should go there. I'm glad we decided to go.
                  This was one of the raddest places<br> I've ever skated! Amazing!</p>

            <h3 id="caption">Zale Bledsoe. Smith Grind, Kansas City, Missouri.</h3>
            <p>Zale is my best friend. This year we finally lived in the same town again and
                 were able to skate<br> a lot. There's nothing I enjoy more than getting to take
                  cool photos of my best friends!
