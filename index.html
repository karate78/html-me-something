            <h3>Blaine Harper. American Dive. New Haven, Connecticut.</h3><br>
            <p>I spent two months in Connecticut this year. We would come
                down to this beach and swim or fish almost every night.</p>

            <h3>Jake Wickersham. Wallride Nollie Out. Lawrence, Kansas.</h3><br>
            <p>Shooting other skatephotographers is always rad! Jake is an
                 amazing young photographer that is really starting to make
                  things happen. He had several photos run in skate magazines
                   this year.</p>

            <h3>Zach Elder. Switch Bluntslide. Kansas City, Missouri.</h3><br>
            <p>I've been skating with Zach for about 15 years now.
                 Zach is not only a great skater but also an amazing
                  videographer. He is currently working on a project
                   for Chophouse Skateboards. I can't wait to see it!</p>

            <h3>Jason Bontrager. Feeble Grind. Kansas City, Kansas.</h3><br>
            <p>We refer to this day as Feeblepalooza. We went to this rail to
                 shoot a photo of my friend Scotty smith grinding it. We didn't
                  really expect Jason to feeble it that day. After Scotty got
                   his trick, Jason starting rolling up to the rail. About fifteen
                    minutes later he rolled away perfectly.</P>

            <h3>Shawn Hale. Backside Noseblunt. Joplin, Missouri.</h3><br>
            <p>Shawn grew up in my hometown of Joplin, Missouri. Shawn is on the
                 verge of turning pro for Birdhouse Skateboards, Tony Hawk's company.
                 The local skate shop flew Shawn in to do a demo in August. It's amazing
                 to see how much he has progressed.</P>

            <h3>Scotty Laird. Bluntslide. Irvinr, California.</h3><br>
            <p>Our friend Yosef took Scotty and I to this ditch in Irvine. When he described
                 it to us, I wasn't really sure we should go there. I'm glad we decided to go.
                  This was one of the raddest places I've ever skated! Amazing!</p>

            <h3>Zale Bledsoe. Smith Grind, Kansas City, Missouri.</h3><br>
            <p>Zale is my best friend. This year we finally lived in the same town again and
                 were able to skate a lot. There's nothing I enjoy more than getting to take
                  cool photos of my best friends!
